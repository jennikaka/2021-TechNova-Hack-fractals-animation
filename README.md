# fractal-collection
The Julia-Set folder is the main project for the TechNova Hackathon 2021.
However, all three sub-projects are created during the 36-hour time frame and severs the same purpose - bridging the gap between mathematics and arts (as well as gender gap in STEM fields).

Problem
- Gender gap in the STEM field
- Girls don’t have enough exposure to the creative side of math/tech
- Don’t know where to start
- High-level math and/or programming is daunting (i.e. calculus, complex numbers, errors on screen)

Solution
- Explore connections between math and arts (i.e., Fractals)
- Let interest inspire learning
- Exposure through playing with Fractals and experimenting with code

What's Unique
- Unconventional
- Aesthetically pleasing
- Spark creativity
- Real math, programming, and art behind the pattern. Namely complex numbers, coordinates, quadratics, recursion, mapping, other fractals, etc.
- “Play is a wonderful place to start learning”

Challenges/Implementation
Due to my limited abilities, I am unable to embed this small application onto a website. Therefore, this works as a stand-alone app that is not very interactive. I hope by learning and exploring more about programming I will be able to make a Fractal Exploration webpage that really helps to bridge the gap.
